# codex
Codex is a web application for learning how to generate or manipulate code. It's built with a vanilla javascript front end, an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and Node.js back end, uses [OpenAI's GPT3 model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/codex) API, and is hosted with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) with [Render](https://render.com/) for cloud database storage. 

The web application is located at [https://codex-blue-chi.vercel.app/](https://codex-blue-chi.vercel.app/). 

From OpenAI's website, use Codex to:
> - Turn comments into code
> - Complete your next line or function in context
> - Bring knowledge to you, such as finding a useful library or API call for an application
> - Add comments
> - Rewrite code for efficiency
